# On-Chain Item Auctions

A simpler, more intuitive on-chain auction experience: Bring any quantifiable “item/share” onto the chain—launch, bid, settle, and withdraw—all in one seamless step.

- More Direct: Native ETH settlement, what you see is what you get
- More Focused: Clear workflow for launching auctions / participating in bids / settling transactions / withdrawing funds
- More Tangible: Supports “item details” (title/specifications/description) so what you see is what you bid on
- More User-Friendly: Page guidance directs you to key actions, avoiding counterintuitive design

- Amounts denominated in ETH and settled on-chain
- Transaction ID uniquely identifies an auction; ensure consistency between seller and buyer
- Verify correct on-chain network and account connection before use
